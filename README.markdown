# TelemetryWeb Tutorial: Home Monitor Sample Application

This is the sample application for
[*The TelemetryWeb Home Monitor Demo*](http://www.telemetryweb.com/)
by [Neal Tovsen](http://blog.telemetryweb.com/).

To use this application:

* Git/Download the source and run it
* (If you don't already have one) Register for a TelemetryWeb account 
* Login with your TelemetryWeb credentials

This application currently supports (i.e. provides examples for):

* Login and session management
* Registration and email account verification
* Query for observations from a sensor called "homemonitor"

Example documents for sensor registration and observations (readings) 
are provided in the examples directory. We recommend using Fiddler 
(if you're running Windows) or similar program to register the sensor 
and publish test observations.
